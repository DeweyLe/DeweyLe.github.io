    <h1>Asian History Month: Recognize achievements and social awareness in an inclusive community.</h1>

    <h3>Canada has long been taking pride in terms of its inclusivity of different cultures around the world. Many have crossed oceans to settle into the new land, looking for building opportunities and helping to improve the country that they could happily consider as their second home.</h3>

    <h3>The theme for this time around is to raise awareness of discrimination in Canada, such a case for a particular South East Asian individual known as Julie Quynh Nhi Tran. Born as a second generation of Vietnamese immigrants, she founded the Groupe d'Entraide Contre le Racisme Envers les Asiatiques au Québec (GECREAQ), an online service aimed at Asian individuals who experienced mental distress from systemic racism during the pandemic. In addition, she also founded Coalition Asiatique pour une Relève Émancipatrice (CARÉ), which serves to improve the local well-being of communities.</h3>

    <h3>This is the perfect personal introduction to address the issues of mental distress. Studies have been conducted to assess the levels of escalating behaviors related to the COVID-19 outbreak specifically in Canada which may lead to depressions, suicidal thought, and especially the rise of systemic racism towards Asian individuals due to the effects of misinformed public health measures. Programs such as the ones being introduced by Julie were fine examples of what Asian-born Canadians are capable of and how they could foster a positive platform to tackle difficult social issues.</h3>

    <h3>The mind has an equal importance function as one's physical spirit, hence why the importance of mental health should be addressed in local communities, especially towards young immigrants from South East Asia who just moved from their country to study in Canada and are looking for a fresh start. The cultural difference means a collaboration between families and institutions are also necessary, ensuring resolutions from dealing with social anxiety and providing a more positive learning outcome that may nurture future Canadian brilliances. Mental health needs more than just calling a crisis line, it is a group effort from different parties to grant a carefree and successful path in an individual's future endeavors.</h3>
